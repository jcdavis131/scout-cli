# Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only
"""`scout coverage` — Codecov replacement, fully local (openswap #31).

Codecov is an uploader plus a web app. This deletes both halves: the coverage
report you already produced (`coverage xml`, `pytest --cov`, or the raw
`.coverage` sqlite) is parsed on THIS box, rolled up per module, compared
against the previous run in a local sqlite history, and rendered into ONE
self-contained HTML file. No token, no `CODECOV_TOKEN`, no upload, no service,
and no account — the manifest disables the network axis with an EMPTY domain
list and `report`/`parse`/`detect` all call `_egress_guard` first, which
re-reads the manifest and REFUSES to run if that section was ever widened. A
coverage report names every file in your repository and how much of it is
untested; not shipping that anywhere is the product.

The real I/O lives here and nothing else does: reading the report files
(`Path.read_bytes` for the XML so its encoding declaration is honoured, sqlite
`mode=ro` for the .coverage), the history store under .scout, and
`Path.write_bytes` for the HTML (bytes, never write_text, so no newline
translation can change the file between platforms). Every judgment —
parsing, merging, the per-module rollup, deltas, the pct-XOR-reason invariant,
the page itself — is deterministic and lives in bigbang/core/coverage.py.

The one thing this refuses to do is invent a zero. A module with no data
renders as UNKNOWN with the reason, never as 0%: an unmeasured module and a
completely untested module look identical on a dashboard, and only one of them
is a crisis. That is why a `.coverage` file ALONE yields covered-line counts
with an UNKNOWN percentage (it stores executed lines, not a statement
inventory), why a missing baseline yields no delta instead of 0.0, and why a
`--context` typo is a hard error listing the real contexts instead of a report
where everything is suddenly uncovered.

Deliberately NOT `runtrack` (#10), whose compare_runs() already deltas metrics
against a baseline run: its store column is `value REAL NOT NULL`, so an
unmeasured module could only be logged as a fabricated 0.0. This store keeps
(statements, covered, pct-or-reason) per module and enforces the XOR with a
sqlite CHECK constraint. See the core module docstring for the full reasoning.
