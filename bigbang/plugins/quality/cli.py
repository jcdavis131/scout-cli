# Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only
"""`scout quality` — SonarQube / CodeClimate replacement, fully local (openswap #30).

Per-function code metrics from the stdlib `ast` — cyclomatic complexity with the
branch breakdown that produced it, function size and nesting depth, imports bound
but never referenced, and TODO-marker density normalized per 100 SLOC — plus the
part the SaaS actually charges for: a HISTORY, so run 12 can be compared with run
11. The history is a sqlite file on this box. There is no scanner token, no
project key and no intake host, so "no source ever left the machine" is
architectural rather than a retention setting.

The ONE real file-read in this plugin is `Path.read_text` in _read_source; the
only write is the sqlite trend store, opened through bigbang.core.quality and
skipped entirely under --no-record. Every judgment is deterministic and lives in
bigbang/core/quality.py, so the whole analyzer is unit testable with strings.

Zero egress is the product, not a setting: SonarCloud and CodeClimate are hosted
services that need your source, and sonar-scanner is a client that requires a
SonarQube SERVER to talk to. The manifest disables the network axis with an EMPTY
domain list, and `detect` and `scan` both call _egress_guard first, which re-reads
the manifest and REFUSES to run if that section was ever widened. There is no
enforce_or_raise call site because there is no outbound call to gate — the guard
is the inverse assertion, and it is what makes the claim falsifiable.

There is no native tier and there will not be one. radon, mccabe, flake8 and
pylint are the open tools in this category and every one is a third-party
dependency the openswap premise forbids; sonar-scanner needs a server. They are
PROBED and surfaced for awareness, never executed, and `detect` says so in
`native_used` on every tier rather than letting tier=native imply a binary
produced these numbers.

NOT a duplicate, and the reasoning is in the core module docstring in full:
scripts/goat_audit.py scores a PLUGIN on a six-dimension rubric from its cli.py
alone and uses a function's line span as an explicit proxy — no branch counting,
no per-function table, one mean per plugin as its only history. `reviewgraph`
stores ast RELATIONSHIPS (imports/calls/fan-in) for review blast radius and
measures nothing about a function's body. `todos` lists markers, which is why
this plugin emits ONE density finding per file and points at `scout todos` for
the listing instead of re-reporting every marker.
