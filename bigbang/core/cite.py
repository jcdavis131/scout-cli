# Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only
"""Cite — BibTeX/CSL-lite store + deterministic formatter (openswap #33: Zotero).

The paid thing being replaced is not the Zotero *reader* (that is free and
local) — it is the STORAGE/SYNC tier and the hosted "citation API" services
around it: your library, your unpublished reading list and your draft
bibliography living in someone else's database, metered by gigabyte. This
adapter keeps the library in a local sqlite file and renders the bibliography
with arithmetic, so the manifest disables the network axis entirely and "the
reading list never left the box" is architectural rather than a ToS promise.

Everything deterministic lives here: the brace-aware BibTeX tokenizer, the
LaTeX-accent decoder, BibTeX name splitting (all three comma forms plus von
particles), the sqlite store, the CSL-JSON mapping and five deterministic
output styles. The plugin CLI owns the ONE real I/O (reading a local .bib/.json
file) plus the fs_write gate on the store, and nothing else.

ROUND-TRIP FIDELITY IS THE CONTRACT, and it is enforced in three places rather
than asserted in a docstring:

[1] Parse keeps EVERY field, including fields no style knows how to render, and
    keeps `field_order` so re-emission is not a re-sort. Unknown entry types are
    kept verbatim with a warning; they are not coerced to @misc, because
    coercion is exactly the silent edit this module exists to prevent.
[2] A malformed entry is REPORTED AND REJECTED, never half-imported. Rejected
    entries come back in their own list with the reason, the line number and the
    raw text, so the operator fixes the .bib instead of discovering three fields
    went missing a month later. `REJECTING_RULES` names them, and a rules
    overlay is FORBIDDEN from disabling one — a data-integrity rule is not a
    style preference (see load_rules).
[3] `roundtrip_report` does the actual experiment: emit the stored entry, parse
    the emission back, and diff type/key/fields/order. `lost_fields` is measured,
    not promised. The store keeps the original entry text next to the normalized
    field rows so the diff can be run against what was really on disk.

Honesty rules that shape the code:
- A rendering has EITHER `text` OR `error`, never both, never neither. A missing
  REQUIRED field for the entry type is an error naming the fields, not a string
  with a hole in it. Missing OPTIONAL fields are listed in `omitted`, so a short
  reference is visibly short rather than quietly short.
- A missing date renders as the CSL-standard `n.d.` — a LABELLED absence, and it
  is also reported in `omitted`. Nothing is ever guessed from the URL, the key
  or the file mtime.
- Value normalization on re-emission is limited to the delimiter (`"x"` and
  `{x}` denote the same value) and is documented as such; @string macros are
  expanded at parse time and each use is recorded in `macros`, so the expansion
  is visible instead of being a silent rewrite.

Stated limits (SCOPE_LIMITS ships in the payload of every command):
- No PDF ingestion and no metadata lookup by DOI/ISBN — both need the network
  this adapter deletes. A DOI is validated for SHAPE and never resolved.
- Five built-in styles, not the 10k-entry CSL style repository: there is no
  .csl XML interpreter here, and `rules` says so.
- @crossref inheritance is NOT resolved (reported as cite:crossref-unresolved).
- Author lists are never truncated to "et al." — a truncation rule differs per
  style edition and a wrong one is a fabricated citation.
- Sorting is a plain lowercase compare, not locale collation.
