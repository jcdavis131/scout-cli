    `base` anchors RELATIVE declared entries somewhere other than the process
    CWD. It exists because two plugins write under a root discovered at runtime
    — tasks uses _repo_root() (walks up from __file__ for pyproject.toml) and
    reviewgraph uses --root — and a static allowlist cannot name a root it does
    not know. A "<repo>" token in the manifest could not fix this either: the
    root is a runtime value (tasks' own test monkeypatches _repo_root to a temp
    dir), so only the caller knows it. Absolute and ~-prefixed entries ignore
    `base` entirely.

    Deliberately does NOT touch the filesystem: a write target usually does not
    exist yet, so Path.resolve()/os.path.realpath would be both wrong (no file
    to stat) and a TOCTOU footgun. abspath() -> normpath() collapses ".." and
    "." LEXICALLY, which is exactly what defeats `.scout/../../etc/passwd`, and
    normcase() case-folds and unifies "/" with "\\" on Windows so the same
    resource spelled either way lands on the same string.

    This function stays lexical. The SYMLINK escape it used to disclaim is now
    caught by _resolves_within(), called from _path_matches() as a second,
    filesystem-aware gate — see the note there, which corrects the reason given

    # Path.expanduser()/Path.resolve() here. expanduser is a pure swap, but

    # precisely what the docstring above rules out. pathlib has no lexical-only

    _norm_path() is deliberately lexical, and that leaves one hole it used to
    disclaim: a symlink (or, on Windows, a directory junction) INSIDE an allowed
    directory pointing outside it satisfies the string comparison while writing
    somewhere else entirely.

    **The stated reason for leaving that open was wrong, and it is worth naming
    because it blocked the fix.** The claim was that blocking it "needs realpath
    on an existing tree, which the not-yet-created-write case rules out".
    os.path.realpath is NOT strict — it resolves whatever prefix exists and
    appends the rest untouched. Measured on this box, with a junction
    allowed/escape -> outside and a target that does not exist:

        lexical  target:  ...\\allowed\\escape\\not_yet_created.txt   inside? True
        realpath target:  ...\\outside\\not_yet_created.txt           inside? False

    So the not-yet-created case never ruled it out. A non-existent path is
    simply returned normalized, which is exactly the old behaviour, so this
    check is a no-op wherever there is nothing to resolve.

    BOTH sides are resolved, which is what keeps legitimate setups working: if
    the allowed root is ITSELF a symlink (a symlinked /tmp on macOS, a redirected
    data dir), root and target move together and the write is still allowed. Only
    a target that leaves the root's REAL location is denied.

    Honest residual, not papered over: this is TOCTOU-checkable, not TOCTOU-proof
    — the link can be swapped between this check and the open(). Closing that
    needs the write to go through an fd opened with O_NOFOLLOW semantics, which
    is a change at every call site, not here. This raises the bar from "string
    prefix" to "must survive resolution at check time"; it does not claim more.

#   fs_write      — a path the PLUGIN chose (its sqlite store, ledger, cache).
#                   capabilities.filesystem.paths is enforced. This is the axis
#                   with security value: it stops a plugin that advertises a
#                   report from also dropping a file in ~/.ssh.
#   fs_write_arg  — a destination the OPERATOR named on the command line
#                   (--out/--db/--csv). Only the write flag is checked. Typing
#                   the path IS the authorization, and re-confirming it against
#                   a manifest is theatre: no allowlist can enumerate every
#                   directory an operator might legitimately choose.

# Collapsing these into one action was tried first and is what makes this gate
# unusable. Enforcing `paths` on operator-named destinations denied
# `statuspage render --out /var/www/status.html`, so the only way to ship a
# working plugin would be to declare `paths: ["/"]` — a gate that protects
# nothing while still reading as enforced. Two ungameable-by-accident actions
# beat one gate everybody routes around.
#
# The integrity of fs_write_arg rests on call sites being honest about
# provenance, exactly as the pre-existing "the plugin loader does not check
# fs_write for us" comments already admit. It is kept auditable by being
# greppable: tests/test_policy.py pins the exact set of fs_write_arg call sites,
