"""Charts — deterministic static SVG core (openswap #16: Grafana Cloud / Tableau).

The paid enemy is a dashboard *server*: you ship your numbers to it, it renders
them, and the picture only exists while you are logged in. This adapter deletes
the server. A chart here is a pure function of data that is ALREADY on this box,
and the output is one self-contained SVG file — no chart library, no JavaScript,
no webfont, no external asset — rendered by string templating so the whole
pipeline is auditable end to end.

The one property that makes this worth writing instead of installing something:
**the output is byte-identical for identical input.** That is what lets a chart
live in git next to the data that produced it and show up in a diff when the
numbers move. Everything that would break it is therefore banned by design:

- No generation timestamp anywhere in the SVG. A "generated at" stamp would make
  every re-render a diff, which is exactly the failure mode this avoids.
- No reliance on source row order. A sqlite SELECT without ORDER BY returns rows
  in an UNDEFINED order, so a renderer that "preserved input order" would emit
  different bytes on different runs over the same file. Ordering comes from the
  data: line/scatter points sort by (x, y), bar categories sort by `--sort`
  (label, or value with label as the tie-break), series sort by label.
- No locale, no timezone, no strftime. Tick labels are assembled from
  time.gmtime fields with explicit %02d formatting, so a chart rendered in
  Denver and in UTC are the same file.
- No float drift in coordinates. Every number in the markup goes through
  `_svg_num`, which rounds to 2 decimals and normalizes -0.0 to 0.

Provenance honesty is the second invariant, and it is why `dataset()` counts
things it could have silently dropped:
- Every chart carries a footer naming the source (file path, or `db#table` for a
  ledger) and the ROW COUNT it read, so a picture can never outlive its data
  without saying so.
- Rows whose y is not a number are SKIPPED and counted (`skipped.bad_y`), never
  coerced to zero — a gap in a metric is not a zero, and a chart that invents
  zeros is worse than no chart.
- Bar duplicates are summed, and the number of folded rows is reported in the
  footer, so an aggregation is never invisible.
- Zero plottable rows renders an explicit empty chart with NO axes numbers: no
  invented range, no line through nothing.

Reading is read-only and non-negotiable for ledgers: `open_readonly` opens with
sqlite `mode=ro`, so charting the shared uptime/runtrack ledgers physically
cannot write to them or take a write lock away from the daemon that owns them.
Table and column names ARE interpolated into the SELECT (they cannot be bound as
parameters), so they are validated against sqlite_master / PRAGMA table_info
first and quoted — an unknown name fails with the real column list instead of
reaching the SQL layer.

Extension points:
- `dataset()` takes rows (a list of dicts) plus a source descriptor, so any
  producer — csv, json, sqlite, a fixture, a future reader — renders identically.
- `render_svg()` takes the dataset dict, never a connection.
- `to_diagnostics()` maps a chart onto the family schema (no rows / nothing
  plottable = warning, skipped rows = info) so `--fail-on` gates a chart exactly
  like prose findings: a dashboard panel that quietly went empty is an incident.
