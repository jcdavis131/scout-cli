# Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only
"""Openswap family base — shared contract for paid-SaaS replacement adapters.

Every openswap adapter (prose = Grammarly Premium, ...) shares three invariants,
and later adapters import them from here instead of re-implementing:

[A] detect_local_capability — probe PATH for the native open-source binary,
    confirm health/version with a cheap read-only subcommand, and return a
    capability report {tier, native: {binary, found, path, version, probe_cmd,
    probe_output}, ...}.
[B] best_available_tier — native binary when present (fastest, fullest) ->
    pure-stdlib fallback core (degraded but working; must self-describe its
    reduced scope via `fallback_scope`) -> explicit "unavailable" with an
    install hint. NEVER a silent no-op and NEVER a network/SaaS fallback tier:
    the privacy guarantee is architectural (zero network calls), so it stays
    falsifiable rather than a ToS promise.
[C] normalized diagnostics — every tier emits the same schema
    {path, line, col, rule, severity, message, suggestion, source} so callers
    never branch on which tier produced a finding.

This module does PURE logic plus local subprocess probing only. No network,
no filesystem writes.
