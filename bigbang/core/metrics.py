# Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only
"""Metrics — host telemetry core (openswap #15: Datadog Infrastructure Monitoring).

Datadog sells two things: an agent that reads the box, and a hosted time series
you rent to keep the readings. This adapter deletes both. The agent is replaced
by three stdlib measurements (shutil.disk_usage, ctypes GlobalMemoryStatusEx /
/proc/meminfo, and a Windows performance counter read through typeperf or
Get-Counter); the hosted series is replaced by an append-only JSONL log plus a
sqlite3 rollup table on this box. There is no API key, no intake endpoint, and
the plugin manifest disables the network axis entirely, so "no telemetry left
this machine" is architectural rather than a ToS promise.

Provenance is the invariant that makes the numbers usable a month later, so it
is enforced rather than documented: reading() REFUSES to build a row that does
not name how it was measured (`how`, e.g. the exact typeperf argv) and which
mechanism produced it (`source`, one of a closed set — stdlib / ctypes / procfs
/ counter / unsupported). Aggregation does not launder that away either: every
rollup row carries the distinct `how` strings of the samples behind it, so a
mean can always be traced back to the API that produced its inputs.

The second invariant is that a failed measurement stays visible. A reading has
EITHER a numeric value OR an error, never both and never neither, and rollups
count error rows separately from the min/max/mean they exclude. A host that
could not be measured must not average out to a healthy one — that is the
failure mode a monitoring adapter cannot be allowed to have.

Real I/O boundaries are injectable, which is what keeps the suite offline and
deterministic: `sample_cpu` takes a `runner` callable (the plugin CLI supplies
the real subprocess; tests supply canned stdout — the certmon `_fetch` pattern),
`sample_memory` takes a `system` name and an optional `probe`, and every `ts` is
an explicit argument. Disk and /proc parsing are pure enough to test for real.

Platform honesty: the counter backends are Windows-only, so on Linux/macOS
`cpu.busy_pct` records source="unsupported" with the reason instead of silently
disappearing from the series. That is scope honesty, not degradation — disk and
memory still collect everywhere.

Extension points:
- More counters: typeperf_argv/powershell_argv take any counter path, and
  parse_typeperf/parse_cooked_value are pure — adding \\Memory\\Pages/sec is a
  spec entry, not new plumbing.
- Thresholds are parameters of to_diagnostics(), which emits the openswap
  diagnostic schema, so `--fail-on` gates a disk-full box exactly like a prose
  lint finding.
- The JSONL is the durable record and sqlite is derived: read_jsonl() replays
  rows in the same shape record_samples() takes, so a lost ledger is rebuildable
  from the log rather than from a vendor's retention window.

    `runner(argv) -> {"returncode": int, "stdout": str, "stderr": str}` is the
    only real I/O and it is injected — the CLI passes subprocess.run, tests pass
    canned output, so the suite never spawns a process. A backend that exits
    nonzero, times out, or prints something unparseable is TRIED AND RECORDED,
    then the next one runs; if none answers the row keeps the error instead of a
    zero, because 0% busy and "could not measure" are opposite facts.
