# Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only
"""Ollama — local-model adapter core (openswap #17: ChatGPT Plus / hosted LLM APIs).

The paid enemy here is a subscription plus a metered key: ChatGPT Plus, the
Anthropic/OpenAI HTTP APIs, and every "AI feature" that bills per token and
keeps a copy of the prompt. This adapter inverts that — inference happens on
THIS box against a local ollama daemon on loopback, there is no API key
anywhere in the plugin (the manifest's secrets allowlist is empty), and the
usage ledger stores a prompt HASH rather than the prompt, because rebuilding
the hosted provider's prompt log locally would give back the thing #17 deletes.

Real I/O stays out of this module: the `ollama` plugin CLI owns the urllib
GET/POST to 127.0.0.1:11434 and injects it as a callable (the
bigbang/core/certmon.py + plugins/certmon/cli.py pattern), so the whole
pipeline — detection, catalog parsing, model choice, completion, degradation,
ledger, diagnostics — is unit-testable fully offline. Nothing here opens a
socket, and `resolve`/`complete` never raise.

RELATIONSHIP TO bigbang/core/llm.py (deliberate, not duplication): that module
is the httpx-based router the `agent`/`ava` planners already call, and it
returns None the moment httpx is absent. #17's premise is zero dependencies, so
the transport here is stdlib urllib and the fallback is a labelled template
instead of a None. Two other differences are substantive, not stylistic:
- llm.get_best_model() ranks a hardcoded PREFERRED_MODELS list biggest-first
  (qwen3:32b before qwen3:8b). pick_model() here is cost-first — explicit
  request, then a model already RESIDENT per /api/ps, then the SMALLEST
  installed — because this box runs ollama with NUM_GPU=0 and the largest
  installed model is the one that thrashes system RAM for minutes per token.
- llm returns prose or None. complete() always returns a record that states
  its provenance: source="model" or source="template" with degraded=True.

NEVER ASSUME GPU. /api/tags reports on-disk blob size and nothing about
placement, so parse_models() reports nothing about placement either. Placement
comes only from /api/ps's size_vram, and placement() maps a MISSING key to
"unknown" rather than "gpu" — printing "gpu" because the machine happens to
own a 4080 while ollama is loading into system RAM is exactly the lie this
family exists to kill.

Reasoning is not a reply. Ollama 0.31+ returns a thinking model's chain of
thought in a separate `thinking` field, so a qwen3 run whose num_predict budget
expires mid-reasoning comes back HTTP 200 with response "" (measured on this box
at --num-predict 24 AND 220). parse_completion refuses to promote that text to
the answer, and no_answer_reason() names the actual cause so the operator raises
the token budget instead of restarting a daemon that is working. The tokens it
burned are still recorded — degraded is not the same as free.

Honest degradation is the load-bearing behavior. When no endpoint answers,
assemble_template() produces a scaffold built ONLY from the caller's own words
(verbatim echo, keyword intent match, stopword-filtered salient terms) whose
first line is DEGRADED_BANNER and which contains the literal marker
"NOT ANSWERED". It does not think, and it says so on every line of its header;
`run --fail-on-degraded` turns that into a nonzero exit for cron/CI.

Extension points:
- Endpoint override as config: candidate_bases(explicit, env) reads
  OLLAMA_BASE/OLLAMA_URL/OLLAMA_HOST from an INJECTED mapping, so tests and
  callers never depend on the developer's shell.
- Generation options as config: complete(options={...}) passes ollama's own
  option block through untouched (num_predict, temperature, num_gpu) — tune
  without touching code.
- Continuous liveness monitoring is NOT here: uptime (#2) already probes
  http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/version as a fleet target with its own damping and
  incident state machine. `detect` is a one-shot capability probe; duplicating
  the monitor would be a second parallel store of the same fact.
- Usage rollups: usage() reports the model-vs-template share (the honesty
  audit: how often did this box actually think?), token totals and tok/s
  percentiles; history() is the per-completion read contract.
