# Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only
"""APM — application performance tracing core (openswap #26: New Relic APM).

New Relic sells an agent that instruments your process and a hosted backend that
keeps the traces. This adapter deletes the backend and rewrites the agent in the
stdlib: `Tracer` is an import-only decorator + context manager that records
nested spans with `time.perf_counter`, spans land in a local sqlite file, and the
transaction/waterfall/flame UI becomes ONE static self-contained HTML page. There
is no license key, no collector endpoint, and the plugin manifest disables the
network axis entirely — "no trace left the box" is architectural, not a ToS
promise.

Three properties decide whether an APM-lite is worth writing instead of renting:

[1] The clock. Durations come from a MONOTONIC counter, never a wall clock.
    `time.time()` on Windows has ~15.6 ms granularity, so a 200 us function
    measures 0.0 — a fabricated zero, which is the exact failure this family
    forbids. `Tracer(clock=...)` defaults to time.perf_counter and REFUSES
    time.time outright (see Tracer.__init__). Wall time is recorded separately
    and once per trace (`wall_start`) purely to answer "when", and every span
    offset is derived from the monotonic clock. Both clocks are injectable, so
    tests pin them and never race a real one.

[2] Honest missing readings. A span has EITHER a duration OR a labelled reason
    it has none — never both, never neither, and never an invented 0.0.
    `check_span` enforces that invariant on construction AND on ingest, so a
    hand-written JSONL row cannot smuggle a fake latency into the store:
      - ok / error      -> duration_ms is required (error also names the failure)
      - unfinished      -> no duration; the process exited inside the span
      - unmeasured      -> no duration; the clock went BACKWARDS (a non-monotonic
                          clock was injected), so the delta is not a measurement
    Aggregates inherit the discipline: percentiles are computed over the measured
    subset only, `unmeasured` is counted beside them, and when nothing was
    measured every numeric field is None with `unmeasured_reason` saying why.

[3] Correct nesting without threading a context object through every call.
    Parenting comes from a contextvars.ContextVar, so `with tracer.span(...)` and
    `@tracer.trace()` nest correctly across call depth, threads and asyncio tasks
    (each gets its own context copy). The parent is restored by writing the saved
    parent back rather than by resetting the ContextVar token, because start/end
    may legitimately happen in different frames.

Deterministic reads on top of the store: operation_stats (per-operation
p50/p95/p99 + error rate), apdex (New Relic's signature score, computed over root
spans = transactions), slowest, trace_rollup, trace_tree (waterfall) and
flame_layout (an aggregate icicle with self-time). render_html turns them into
the static page; it takes `generated_ts` as an argument and omits the stamp when
it is None, so identical input renders byte-identical output and a report can
live in git next to the data that produced it.

Extension points:
- Instrument anything: `tracer = apm.Tracer(service="trainer")` then decorate.
  Nothing here imports the CLI, so a daemon can use the core directly.
- Ship spans between processes: to_jsonl_lines / parse_span_line round-trip the
  validated schema; `scout apm ingest` is just that parser plus a store write.
  The store's UNIQUE(trace_id, span_id) makes re-ingesting the same file a no-op.
- Budgets as config: to_diagnostics(slow_ms=, critical_ms=, error_rate_error=)
  maps operations onto the openswap diagnostic schema, so `--fail-on` gates a
  latency regression exactly like a prose lint finding.
- No network tier ever: New Relic's product IS the hosted collector, so there is
  no native binary to prefer and detect() reports tier=fallback as the expected
  steady state.
