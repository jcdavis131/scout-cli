# Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only
"""Searchindex — build-time site-search index (openswap #23: Algolia DocSearch).

Algolia's product is not "a search engine" — it is a HOSTED index plus a
JavaScript widget: you push your pages to their cluster, hold an API key, and
their CDN answers your visitors' keystrokes. This adapter deletes the cluster
and the key and keeps the widget: `scout searchindex build` reads the pages you
own, tokenizes them, and emits a STATIC ARTIFACT — sharded JSON posting lists
plus one dependency-free JS client — that you deploy next to the site. The
visitor's browser fetches the manifest and exactly the shards their query
routes to; nothing is sent anywhere, so "no query ever left the visitor" is
architectural, not a privacy policy.

Why this is NOT search #20 (which also names Algolia): #20 is a sqlite3 FTS5
database that only this box can query (Python + sqlite + the .db file). It
cannot ship. This one produces deployable bytes that a browser executes with no
server, no Python and no sqlite at runtime — the on-site search box. The two
share a corpus layer on purpose (`search.iter_files`, `search.read_document`)
rather than each growing its own walker.

The pipeline, all deterministic and all here:
- fold/tokenize/stem — NFKD fold, combining marks dropped, `[a-z0-9]+` runs,
  stopwords, and a guarded light stemmer (plurals + -ing/-ed with a 3-char
  minimum stem, so "user" never collapses into "use").
- extract_document — per-page fields. HTML title/description/h1/noindex come
  from seo #3's parse_page (reused, not re-implemented); body text comes from a
  boilerplate-aware html.parser pass; markdown gets front-matter and syntax
  stripped. A `noindex` page is EXCLUDED and says so.
- build_index — weighted per-field term scores (title 8, heading 4,
  description 3, path 2, body 1 by default; integers so a posting is byte-exact
  in JSON), first-character routing so a prefix query needs ONE shard, and a
  balanced route plan whose table ships in the manifest (the client never
  guesses where a term lives).
- render_files — every artifact byte, ready for the caller to write: sorted-key
  compact ASCII JSON with a trailing newline, sha256 per file, and a content
  fingerprint that EXCLUDES generated_utc, so "did the content change" and
  "when was it built" stay separable.
- rank — the BM25-ish ranking the JS client implements, in Python, so the
  ranking is testable without a browser. The client is a CONSTANT that reads
  every parameter (weights, k1/b, stopwords, routes, limits) from the manifest,
  so no number is duplicated; only the fold/stem/rank LOGIC is mirrored, and a
  node-present test runs the real JS against the real artifact to prove the two
  agree hit for hit.
- verify — re-hash what is on disk against the manifest, so a half-deployed or
  stale shard is a caught error rather than a silently empty search box.

Honesty rules this core keeps:
- The index alphabet is ASCII `[a-z0-9]` after folding. Latin diacritics fold
  in ("café" -> cafe); CJK/Cyrillic/Greek do NOT, so their characters are
  COUNTED per page and reported (`unsupported_chars` + a diagnostic), never
  silently dropped to make a build look clean.
- A page with no indexable term is reported (`empty-page`), and a build with no
  terms at all is an ERROR — an index that matches nothing is the silent no-op
  the family bans.
- `url` is only absolute when the caller supplies --base-url; otherwise it is
  the site-root-relative path, labelled `url_kind: "relative"`. No domain is
  ever invented.
- Every number in a report is measured. A skipped page carries its reason.

# the file below is byte-identical across builds. What IS mirrored is the logic:
# fold/tokenize/stem and the BM25 accumulation. tests/test_searchindex.py runs
# this exact file under node against a real artifact and asserts hit-for-hit
# agreement with rank() (skipped, and said so, where node is absent).
