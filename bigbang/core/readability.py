# Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only
"""Readability — pure-stdlib readability scoring (openswap #21: Hemingway Editor Plus).

This is the arithmetic half of the prose gate: Flesch reading ease, Flesch-Kincaid
grade, Gunning fog, Coleman-Liau, a sentence-length histogram, adverb/passive
budgets, and per-paragraph + per-sentence difficulty bands (Hemingway's yellow
"hard" / red "very hard" highlighting, as data). It is a MODULE OF #1, not a
second plugin: `bigbang/core/prose.py` already owns markdown/HTML extraction,
paragraph splitting and the passive-voice matcher, so this file imports them
rather than growing a parallel copy, and the findings surface as
`scout prose score` / `scout prose report` plus a `readability` rule inside
`scout prose lint`. prose.py's own module docstring named this extension point.

Everything here is PURE logic — no network, no filesystem, no subprocess (the
plugin CLI supplies the I/O, same split as reach/statuspage).

Honesty about the numbers, because a readability score is easy to fake:

- Syllables are a HEURISTIC (vowel-group counting + silent-e/-ed/-es fixes).
  It undercounts adjacent vowels pronounced separately ("cre-ate", "i-de-a")
  and mis-handles a few silent clusters, so SYLLABLE_EXCEPTIONS pins the common
  English words where it is known wrong. Nothing here claims dictionary-grade
  syllabification, which is why COLEMAN-LIAU (letters per word — no syllables
  at all) is reported next to the syllable-based scores: when the two disagree
  the syllable heuristic is doing the work, and the report says so.
- Pure numerals ("2026", "9.5") are counted as neither words nor syllables:
  their spoken length is unknowable from spelling, exactly the reasoning behind
  prose's acronym guard in the a/an rule. `counts.numeric_excluded` reports how
  many were dropped so the denominator is never silently wrong.
- Gunning fog's classic definition excludes proper nouns and familiar
  compounds; detecting those from spelling alone is unreliable, so this
  implementation applies only the suffix half of the rule (-es/-ed/-ing that
  pushes a word to three syllables) and declares the omission in `notes`.
- Every formula is unstable on tiny samples, so document-level findings are
  suppressed below `min_words` and per-sentence bands below
  `min_sentence_words`; the scores are still reported, with a note.

Extension points: thresholds are policy-as-config in DEFAULT_CONFIG (overlaid by
`scout prose lint --rules`, like every other prose rule). A new formula is one
function plus one line in `_metrics`, and it then flows into the JSON, the HTML
metrics table and — if it returns a grade — the consensus median. A new finding
is one block in `to_diagnostics`; the severity gate, summary and `--fail-on`
plumbing are already shared with #1.
