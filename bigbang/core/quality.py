"""Quality — per-function AST code metrics with history (openswap #30: SonarQube / CodeClimate).

What the paid products sell is not the arithmetic — McCabe published cyclomatic
complexity in 1976 and `ast` ships in the stdlib. What they sell is a SERVER that
keeps the time series so today's number means something next to last week's, and
a quality gate wired to it. This adapter deletes the server: the metrics are
computed here from source text, and the history lives in a sqlite file on this
box. There is no scanner token, no project key and no intake host, so "no source
ever left the machine" is architectural rather than a retention promise.

MEASURES (all per FUNCTION, then rolled up per file and per run):
- cyclomatic complexity, reported WITH the per-node-type breakdown that produced
  it (`decisions`), because tools disagree about what a decision point is;
- size: physical `lines`, `statements`, `max_depth` of nesting, `params`;
- dead imports: bound names never referenced in their own module;
- TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX/BUG density, normalized per 100 SLOC;
- module-level complexity, so a script whose whole flow is at import time cannot
  score clean just because it defines no functions.

OVERLAP — checked before a line was written, and stated because a near-duplicate
would be a failure rather than a delivery:

* `scripts/goat_audit.py` scores a PLUGIN on a six-dimension rubric by reading
  ONLY that plugin's cli.py, and its size signal is deliberately a proxy: the
  longest function's line SPAN, "a proxy, not a verdict". It has no notion of
  cyclomatic complexity, no per-function table, no unused-import analysis, and
  its only persistence is one mean per plugin in .goat_baseline.json. This module
  is the other axis: every function in an arbitrary tree, real branch counting,
  and a run-indexed sqlite series. goat_audit stays the rubric; nothing here
  scores a plugin and nothing here should be wired into that baseline file.
* `bigbang/plugins/reviewgraph` also parses Python with `ast` into sqlite, so the
  distinction matters: reviewgraph stores RELATIONSHIPS (imports, calls,
  inherits) to answer "what does this diff touch" and rank fan-in for review
  context. It measures no property of a function's body, and its `compute_risks`
  is fan-in/import-cycles/git-churn — coupling, not complexity. This module
  stores per-unit MEASUREMENTS over time and answers "did this get worse".
  Neither is a superset; the drift guard in the tests pins PY_EXTS against
  reviewgraph's suffix set so the two cannot disagree about what Python is.
* `bigbang/plugins/todos` already lists markers. That is why nothing here emits a
  per-marker finding: this module emits ONE density finding per file and defers
  the listing to `scout todos`. The two also differ on purpose — todos matches
  case-insensitively (a listing tool wants recall) while density needs precision,
  so MARKERS here are matched case-sensitively in upper case; "works around a bug
  in json" must not inflate a ratio. The marker WORD set is drift-guarded against
  todos.MARKER_RE and goat_audit's NOTE_RE in the tests instead of being retyped
  on faith, because extension-list drift between modules is a known bug class in
  this repo. This module also reads markers from `tokenize` COMMENT tokens rather
  than a line regex, so a "# TODO" inside a string literal is not counted, and
  the count of markers that appear in STRING tokens is reported separately as a
  labelled exclusion rather than silently dropped.
* `bigbang/core/prose.py` + `readability.py` score natural-language prose
  (Flesch, passive voice). Different input axis entirely: no code is parsed there
  and no English is scored here.
* SIBLING RISK, stated rather than denied: ranks 29-34 are being built
  concurrently and are not visible from here. Anything in that batch replacing a
  dependency/SBOM/licence scanner will also enumerate a module's imports, and
  anything replacing a coverage service will also walk Python with `ast`. If a
  sibling landed import enumeration, `import_bindings` is the seam to share and
  the honest fix is to derive one from the other, not to keep both.

HONESTY RULES that shape the code:
- A file has EITHER metrics OR an `error`, never both, never neither, and
  `record_run` re-checks that at the storage boundary. `counts` is None on a
  file that could not be read or parsed, not a row of zeros: zero complexity is
  a measurement, and no measurement was taken.
- Every run stores a fingerprint of the weight table that produced it, so
  `compare_runs` REFUSES to call a difference a regression when the two runs were
  measured under different weights. Re-tuning a threshold must not manufacture a
  trend.
- Means are None when there is nothing to average, never 0.0.
- The weight table is data (`DEFAULT_CONFIG["weights"]`, published by the CLI and
  overlayable with JSON): radon, mccabe and lizard do not agree on `assert`,
  boolean operators or comprehensions, so the choice is exposed and the
  per-function `decisions` breakdown makes any single score auditable instead of
  asking the reader to trust it.
