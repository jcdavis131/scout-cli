# Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only
"""Contentgap — TF-IDF draft-vs-corpus coverage core (openswap #24: Clearscope).

Clearscope (and Surfer/MarketMuse) sell one loop: paste a draft, they crawl the
pages already ranking for your topic, weight the vocabulary those pages share,
and hand back "terms you are missing". Everything expensive about that is the
crawl — which is also the part that ships your unpublished draft to someone
else's box. This adapter deletes the crawl: the comparison corpus is FILES
ALREADY ON DISK (whatever you saved, exported or extracted earlier), the term
weighting is `collections.Counter` plus `math.log`, and the manifest disables
the network axis outright. Zero egress is the product, not a setting.

Everything here is pure: text in, verdict out. No sockets, no sqlite, no disk.
The plugin CLI owns the one real I/O (reading the draft and the corpus files)
so the whole pipeline is unit-testable with string literals.

The arithmetic, stated so a number can be checked by hand:

- tokenizer: `[^\\W_]+` runs (letters and digits, underscore excluded) joined by
  internal hyphens/apostrophes, casefolded, trailing possessive dropped. Markup
  is stripped FIRST by reusing bigbang.core.prose's markdown/HTML extractors —
  code fences, URLs, script/style never reach the counter, and this module ships
  no second copy of that logic.
- a "term" is a token that is >= `min_length` chars, is not all digits and is
  not a closed-class stopword; a "phrase" is two adjacent terms inside the same
  segment (never spanning a line/paragraph break, so `## GPU\\nClocks drift`
  does not invent "gpu clocks").
- tf is sublinear: `1 + log(count)`. One page repeating a word 90 times must not
  outvote nine pages using it twice.
- idf is smoothed: `log((N+1)/(df+1)) + 1`, so a term used by EVERY comparison
  page keeps weight 1.0 instead of collapsing to zero. That matters here and is
  the opposite of what a retrieval ranker wants: the terms every competitor
  covers are exactly the ones a draft must not miss.
- a term's corpus `weight` (its importance) is the mean of `tf * idf` over ALL
  usable corpus docs, so spread and intensity are one number: a term in 1 of 10
  pages is divided by 10 just the same as one in all 10.
- `expected` mentions for the draft is density-normalized:
  `corpus_count / corpus_tokens * draft_tokens`. A 300-word draft is never
  scolded for lacking the 14 mentions a 3,000-word page had.
- classify(): 0 mentions is `missing`; below `max(1, ceil(expected *
  thin_ratio))` is `thin` with partial credit; above `expected * over_ratio`
  (and at least `over_floor` mentions) is `overused` — Clearscope's
  over-optimization warning, which a naive "more keywords" tool never gives you.
- coverage_score = 100 * sum(weight * credit) / sum(weight) over the target
  terms. `overused` scores full credit (stuffing is reported separately, it does
  not inflate or deflate coverage).

Honesty rules this module enforces rather than documents:
- reading() carries EITHER a value OR a labelled error, never both, never
  neither. An empty corpus produces `coverage_score: {value: None, error:
  "..."}` and an `error`-severity `contentgap:unmeasured` diagnostic — an audit
  that could not measure must never read as a pass.
- a corpus file that cannot be counted (unreadable, too large, no words after
  markup extraction) lands in `skipped` WITH its reason and is excluded from
  N/df/idf. Silently dropping it would quietly move every weight.

Extension points:
- Budgets as config: analyze(thin_ratio=, over_ratio=, over_floor=,
  target_score=) tunes the gate without touching code.
- Corpus shape: build_corpus() takes [{name, text, format}] from anywhere — a
  directory of saved pages today, `scout extract`'s cached document store or a
  sitemap crawl's text later, with no change here.
- Family gate: to_diagnostics() maps gaps onto the openswap diagnostic schema,
  so `contentgap audit --fail-on warning` gates a publish exactly like a prose
  finding or an uptime outage.
- Native tier: there is none to prefer. Clearscope, Surfer and MarketMuse are
  browser apps with hosted APIs; no local binary does draft-vs-corpus coverage,
  so the plugin's detect() reports tier=fallback as the steady state.
