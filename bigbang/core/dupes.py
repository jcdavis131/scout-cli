# Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only
"""Dupes — near-duplicate content detector core (openswap #28: Copyscape).

The paid enemy here is the worst shape of SaaS in this whole table: Copyscape's
"premium" plagiarism check works by UPLOADING the text you have not published
yet to someone else's index, per query, per page. This adapter inverts that
completely — the corpus is the local tree, the arithmetic is k-shingling with
hashlib fingerprints, and the manifest disables the network axis entirely, so
"the unpublished draft never left the box" is architectural rather than a ToS
promise. Nothing in this module opens a socket, a file or a subprocess: the
plugin CLI owns the ONE real I/O (reading local files as bytes) and hands this
module `bytes`/`str`, which is why the whole pipeline is unit-testable offline.

The algorithm (Broder's shingling, re-derived in stdlib):
- tokenize: markdown/HTML/plain text -> a lowercase word stream. The markup
  strippers are REUSED from prose #1 (extract_markdown blanks code fences,
  inline code, URLs and tags with a NUL sentinel that no word token can span;
  extract_html skips script/style/code/pre/kbd/samp), so a fenced code block
  cannot be mistaken for recycled prose and there is no second copy of that
  logic to drift. What that does NOT do is strip page chrome: extract_html
  keeps nav/footer/aside text, so a shared nav bar contributes shingles to
  every page that carries it. That is a stated limit, not a silent one — the
  fix is to feed analyze() the article bodies from extract #11 (whose whole job
  is link-density boilerplate removal) instead of raw HTML, which is exactly
  the "corpus sources" extension point below.
- shingle: every contiguous window of `k` tokens -> one blake2b digest over the
  tokens joined by a byte (0x1f) that cannot occur inside a token, so
  ["ab","c"] and ["a","bc"] are different shingles instead of colliding.
  Digests are `digest_bits` wide (64 by default = 16 hex chars); the birthday
  bound at 64 bits is ~5e9 shingles for an even-odds collision, i.e. far past
  any local corpus, and widening it is one config key.
- compare: Jaccard |A n B| / |A u B| for "these two pages are the same page",
  PLUS containment |A n B| / min(|A|,|B|) for "this short draft is a slice of
  that long published page" — the partial-lift case Jaccard structurally
  underweights when lengths differ, and the case a plagiarism checker exists
  for. Both are reported; either can trip a finding.
- cluster: pairs above the gates are union-found into connected components, so
  five recycled variants of one paragraph report as ONE cluster of five and not
  as ten pairs a human has to re-assemble.

Hot path (Carmack): the pairwise comparison never intersects sets. One pass
over the shingle->documents postings index yields the exact shared-shingle
COUNT for every pair that shares at least one shingle, and Jaccard/containment
are pure arithmetic on (shared, |A|, |B|). Pairs sharing nothing are never
visited at all — they cannot clear a positive threshold. `jaccard()` (the set
definition) and `jaccard_from_counts()` (the hot path) are both public and
tested against each other, so the fast path can never quietly diverge from the
definition it claims to implement.

Determinism is a hard requirement (a duplicate report belongs in git next to
the pages it judges, and must diff clean when nothing moved):
- fingerprints come from hashlib, NEVER from builtin hash(), whose seed is
  randomized per process (this repo has already shipped one hash()-as-seed bug)
- document ids are posix-style relative paths, so a report is identical on
  Windows and Linux
- shingle order is first-appearance, pair order is (kind, -similarity, a, b),
  cluster order is (-size, first member), and every list of ids is sorted

Honesty is enforced rather than documented — every reading has EITHER a value
OR a labelled reason, never both and never neither:
- a document too short to shingle gets `errors["shingles"]` naming the token
  count and the bound it missed; it is NEVER compared and NEVER reported as
  0.0 similar
- a document with no extractable words gets no content hash (a sha256 of the
  empty string is not evidence of content)
- an exact-content pair whose documents are both too short to shingle reports
  `similarity: None` with the reason, because no shingle sets exist to compare
- unmeasured documents are surfaced as info-level diagnostics, so "nothing was
  silently skipped" is checkable in the same envelope as the findings

Extension points:
- Thresholds/severities as config: merge_config() overlays a JSON dict onto
  DEFAULT_CONFIG (unknown keys raise rather than being silently ignored, which
  is how a typo'd threshold becomes an invisible pass), so per-surface policy
  needs no code edit.
- Corpus sources: analyze() takes documents as {"id", "text", "fmt"} dicts. Any
  producer works — the plugin walks a tree today; the seo #3 crawl store's page
  bodies and the extract #11 corpus ledger are the same shape.
- Native tier: there is none to prefer. Copyscape is SaaS; fdupes/rdfind/jdupes
  find BYTE-identical files only (they cannot see a reworded paragraph) and
  jscpd is a node code-clone detector, so they are surfaced by the plugin's
  detect and never executed.
