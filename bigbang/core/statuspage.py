# Solo personal project, no connection to employer, built with public/free-tier only
"""Statuspage — static status page core (openswap #18: StatusPage.io / Atlassian).

The paid enemy is a hosted page you pay to publish and a wire protocol you pay
to feed. This adapter deletes both halves: the page is one self-contained HTML
file rendered from ledgers that ALREADY exist on this box, and there is no feed
at all because this adapter collects NOTHING. Every number on the page was
recorded by uptime (#2), certmon (#9) or heartbeat (#6); statuspage only reads.

Read-only is architectural, not a promise: open_readonly() hands back a sqlite
connection opened with `mode=ro`, so INSERT/UPDATE/CREATE against the shared
monitoring ledger physically fail (sqlite raises "attempt to write a readonly
database"). A future edit to this module cannot quietly start collecting, and
the page can never contend for the write lock that uptime's probe loop holds.

Provenance honesty is the other invariant, and it is why this module is bigger
than a template renderer:
- Services are derived from what was RECORDED (`SELECT DISTINCT target FROM
  checks`), never from uptime.DEFAULT_TARGETS. Listing configured-but-never-
  probed services would imply coverage that does not exist.
- A source counts as `present` only when its table exists AND holds a row. A
  `certs` table created by a certmon run that recorded nothing is not evidence
  of certificate monitoring.
- An absent ledger renders the no-data state (overall "no_data", uptime_pct
  None, an explicit "nothing was recorded on this box" block). It never
  degrades into a green board, and it is not an error — a status page whose
  data source vanished must SAY so, which is exactly when a page matters most.
- Staleness counts against the roll-up: a green board built from three-day-old
  checks is a lie, so a service whose newest check is older than stale_after_s
  is flagged and drags `overall` down to degraded.
- Grace periods are deliberately NOT guessed for heartbeat rows. Those live in
  heartbeat's JSON config; this page reports the ledger's own confirmed hb:
  state plus the age of the last beat, and calls nothing "late" on authority
  it does not have.

Substrate reuse (no reinvented SQL): board()/rollup()/list_incidents()/
recent_events() from #2, board() from #9 — the read contracts those modules
document for exactly this consumer — plus heartbeat.NS so a daemon named like a
service can never be reported as one.

Extension points:
- Window and staleness budgets are parameters (window_hours, stale_after_s):
  feed them from the CLI or a JSON overlay, don't tune code.
- render_html() takes the snapshot dict, not a connection, so any producer of
  that shape (a merged multi-box snapshot, a fixture) can be rendered.
- to_diagnostics() maps the page onto the family schema (down=error,
  degraded/stale/no-ledger=warning, unknown=info), so openswap.summarize() and
  `--fail-on` gate on a status page exactly like prose findings.
