"""Readability — openswap #21 (Hemingway Editor Plus -> local arithmetic).

Shipped as a MODULE OF #1 (`scout prose score` / `prose report` + a `readability`
rule inside `prose lint`), so these tests cover bigbang/core/readability.py, its
integration into prose's check registry and rules overlay, and the two new CLI
surfaces. Offline and deterministic by construction: the scorer is pure
arithmetic, the plugin manifest denies the network axis, and the only I/O is a
tmp_path HTML write whose capability gate is exercised in both directions.

Every expected number below was computed by hand from the published formula (the
test docstrings carry the arithmetic) rather than recorded from a run, so a
change in tokenizing, syllable counting or sentence splitting fails the test
instead of quietly re-baselining it.
